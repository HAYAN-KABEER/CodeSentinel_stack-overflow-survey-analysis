# CodeSentinel_stack-overflow-survey-analysis
Data Analysis of the Stack Overflow Developer Survey Dataset using Python (Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, NumPy).  Includes data cleaning, grouping, aggregation, visualization, and exporting insights for decision-making.
This project is part of my **Data Analysis Internship (Task 4) at Code Sentinel**.  
I analyzed the **Stack Overflow Developer Survey Dataset** using Python and Jupyter Notebook.  

The goal of this project was to clean, analyze, and visualize the dataset to extract useful insights using techniques like grouping, aggregation, and data visualization.
- Python
- Jupyter Notebook
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
   - Handled missing values
   - Removed irrelevant data
   - Ensured consistency for analysis

2. Grouping & Aggregation
   - Summarized data with statistical measures
   - Applied multiple aggregation functions on columns

3. Data Visualization
   - Bar charts to compare distributions
   - Pie charts to show proportions
   - Exported results to CSV files
